Minesweeper
===========

Classic Minesweeper in JavaScript (built using Jade, Stylus and jQuery).

This was my starter project in our research group for the [Touch Art Gallery (TAG)](http://cs.brown.edu/research/ptc/tag "Touch Art Gallery") project under Prof. Andy Van Dam.

##Known Issues

- Winning and losing messages are not shown.
- User interface for picking custom grid sizes has not yet been implemented.
- No reset button.
- No flagging.
- UI needs to be refined a lot more.
- Automatic reset of board so that the first clicked block is a zero (no surrounding mines) has not been implemented.
- No time or points system.
